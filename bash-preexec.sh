# bash-preexec.sh -- Bash support for ZSH-like 'preexec' and 'precmd' functions.
# https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec
#
#
# 'preexec' functions are executed before each interactive command is
# executed, with the interactive command as its argument.  The 'precmd'
# function is executed before each prompt is displayed.
#
# Author: Ryan Caloras (ryan@bashhub.com)
# Forked from Original Author: Glyph Lefkowitz
#
# V0.2.2
#

# General Usage:
#
#  1. Source this file at the end of your bash profile so as not to interfere
#     with anything else that's using PROMPT_COMMAND.
#
#  2. Add any precmd or preexec functions by appending them to their arrays:
#       e.g.
#       precmd_functions+=(my_precmd_function)
#       precmd_functions+=(some_other_precmd_function)
#
#       preexec_functions+=(my_preexec_function)
#
#  3. If you have anything that's using the Debug Trap, change it to use
#     preexec. (Optional) change anything using PROMPT_COMMAND to now use
#     precmd instead.
#
#  Note: This module requires two bash features which you must not otherwise be
#  using: the "DEBUG" trap, and the "PROMPT_COMMAND" variable. prexec_and_precmd_install
#  will override these and if you override one or the other this will most likely break.
